Priority Trees in Priority Census Blocks in Tacoma,WA

In 2019, PlanIT-Geo, an urban forestry nonprofit, calculated urban forestry scores across the city of Tacoma, Washington. Using the i-Tree Eco tool from the US Forest Service, the team found fifteen census blocks with the worst scores across urban tree canopy (UTC) percentage, vegetation percentage, and soil percentage to name just a few indicators. Shown below, those census blocks surround the Tacoma Mall in downtown Tacoma, a highly developed area with little green space. 

The map displays large street trees in these priority census blocks. Large trees meant a diameter breast height (DBH) between 18 and 30 inches, and street trees had to at least be within 25 meters of a street. Much of the data was derived from satellite imagery and Lidar, so some caution can be taken for those measurements. However, if the same parameters applied for all public trees in Tacoma, then there are only three large street trees in Tacoma's highest priority census blocks. Large trees are important for those census blocks because they provide the greatest ecosystem benefits. However, street trees often need the most maitenance, so the upkeep of those three trees is important to ensure the greatest environmental benefits for areas with already low canopy coverage.

Ta-da. Very tired.
